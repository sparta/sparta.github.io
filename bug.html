<H3>Latest Features and Bug Fixes in SPARTA 
</H3>
<P>This page is a continuous listing of new features and bug fixes for
the SPARTA simulator.
</P>
<P>In some cases, new features change the syntax or operation of an
existing input script command, which can cause SPARTA output to
change, or even "break" an earlier working script.  These cases are
highlighted below with a "BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY" note.
</P>
<P>To stay up-to-date with the current SPARTA, you can download the
current tarball from the <A HREF = "https://sjplimp.github.io/download.html">download page</A> at any time, and
re-build the code.  It will include all the features/fixes listed
below.
</P>


<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "version"></A>What version of SPARTA do you have? 
</H4>
<P>A SPARTA "version" is the date when it was released, such as 10 Aug
2014.  SPARTA is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or add
a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of SPARTA contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  The version date is printed to the
screen and logfile every time you run SPARTA.  It is also in the file
src/version.h and in the SPARTA directory name created when you unpack
a tarball.
</P>
<UL><LI>If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the SPARTA WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of SPARTA. 

<LI>If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages included in your tarball, they
describe the version you have.

<UL><LI>Removed parent cells from the data structures used to store the
logical structure of the hierarchical grid used in SPARTA.  Each
processor now stores only the child cells it owns (plus ghost child
cells).  For large grids with many levels of adaptation this reduces
the memory cost significantly, since previously each processor stored
a copy of all the parent cells. <A HREF = "https://github.com/sparta/sparta/pull/192">PR

elements to grid cells was reformulated since it previously relied on
parent cells. <A HREF = "https://github.com/sparta/sparta/pull/192">PR

<P>This patch release contains 3 new features:
</P>
<UL><LI>3 new computes which tally counts of reactions at surfaces
<LI>Options for transparent surfaces, useful for talling statistics
<LI>3 new surface collision models - work by Krishnan Gopalan (NASA) 
</UL>
<P>More details:
</P>
<P>a) The new computes which tally surface reactions are <A HREF = "doc/compute_react_surf.html">compute
react/surf</A>, <A HREF = "doc/compute_react_isurf_grid.html">compute
react/isurf/grid</A>, and <A HREF = "doc/compute_react_boundary.html">compute
react/boundary</A>.  <A HREF = "doc/compute_react_isurf_grid.html">Compute
react/isurf/grid</A> can be used with
the <A HREF = "doc/fix_ablate.html">fix ablate</A> comand to drive surface ablation,
either by itself or in conjunction with the <A HREF = "doc/fix_ave_grid.html">fix
ave/grid</A> command.
</P>
<P>In addition, when gas reactions are defined by the
<A HREF = "doc/react.html">react</A> command, or surface reactions are defined by
the <A HREF = "doc/surf_react.html">surf_react</A> command, the counts of each
reaction that occurred during a run are now printed to the screen and
logfile at the end of the run.  This is discussed
<A HREF = "doc/Section_start.html#start_7">here</A>.  The surface reaction
quantities are likewise stored by the <A HREF = "doc/surf_react.html">surf_react</A>
command, so that they can be accessed by <A HREF = "doc/variable.html">variables</A>
or <A HREF = "stats_style.html">stats</A> output.
</P>
<P>b) See the <A HREF = "doc/Section_howto.html#howto_15">Section Howto 6.15</A> doc page
for a description of how to define and use transparent surfaces.
</P>
<P>c) These are the new surface collision models:
</P>
<UL><LI>cll = Cercignani, Lampis, and Lord collision model
<LI>td = thermal desorption collision model from Krishnan Gopalan
<LI>impulsive = collision model for high translational and low internal energies, e.g. a beam of particles, also from Krishnan Gopalan 
</UL>
<P>Details are described on the <A HREF = "doc/surf_collide.html">surf collide</A> doc
page.

15Oct19 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>15 Oct 2019</B>
</P>
<P>Added the following commands to enable ablation modeling of implicit
surfaces:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "doc/fix_ablate.html">fix ablate</A>
<LI><A HREF = "doc/compute_isurf_grid.html">compute isurf/grid</A>
<LI><A HREF = "doc/write_isurf.html">write_isurf</A> 
</UL>
<P>These files may also be useful.  The former contains example input
scripts and log files.  The latter gives an overview of ablation
modeling with SPARTA and the relevant commands to use.
</P>
<UL><LI>examples/ablation
<LI><A HREF = "doc/Section_howto.html#howto_14">doc/Section_howto.html#howto_14</A> 
</UL>
<P>Also enabled use of a variable temperature in the <A HREF = "doc/surf_collide.html">surf_collide
diffuse</A> command, to model time-dependent
surface temperatures.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.15Oct19">list of changed files</A> versus the

</P>
<HR>

<P><B>9 Sep 2019</B>
</P>
<P>Extended the <A HREF = "doc/read_surf.html">read_surf</A>,
<A HREF = "doc/write_surf.html">write_surf</A>, and <A HREF = "doc/read_isurf.html">read_isurf</A>
commands to work with explicit, distributed, and implicit surfaces.
For simulations with large counts of explicit surfaces, multiple files
can be used so that the reading and writing can be done in parallel
from many processors.  The explicit surface data file now has 2
formats, with and without a Points section. If the section is not
included, individual point coords are listed with the line and surface
elements. Lines and Triangles now have a unique ID. The lines and
triangles do not need to be listed in order in the file(s), which will
typically be the case in a file written when surface elements are
distributed.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "doc/write_surf.html">write_surf</A> and
<A HREF = "doc/read_surf.html">read_surf</A> commands for details.  Also added
support for the clip operation in the <A HREF = "doc/read_surf.html">read_surf</A>
command for distributed surfaces.
</P>
<P>Fixed a bug with the <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump image ssao</A> command
which was reading the dfactor parameter incorrectly.
</P>

<P><B>16 Apr 2019</B>
</P>
<P>Arnaud Borner (NASA Ames) added a marching cubes algorithm to enable
3d implicit surfaces (triangles) to be used in a simualation model.
</P>
<P>See these doc pages and example scripts for more info
on using 3d implicit surfaces in a simulation:

<P>Some bug fixes in the collision model (non hard-sphere case) and for
recombination reactions and the TCE reaction model.  These were either
corner cases or small effects.  Thanks to Israel Sebastiao (Purdue U),
Arnaud Borner (NASA Ames Research Center), and @j-d-fuhr (GitHub).
</P>
<P>Added rendezvous method for summing surface tallies for output.
Should be much faster for large surface element counts or large
processor counts.
</P>
<P>Various Kokkos optimizations.
</P>
<P>Low-memory version of reading/writing restart files via the <A HREF = "doc/global.html">global
mem/limit</A> command.
</P>
<P>Added some more statistics (mean, min, max, variance) to timing output
at the end of runs.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.15Apr19">list of changed files</A> versus the
15Feb19 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>15 Feb 2019</B>
</P>
<P>Added support for distributed surface elements and for implicit 2d
surfaces defined by grid cell corner point values.  This means there
are 3 flavors of surfaces now supported: non-distributed explicit (as
before, the default), distributed explicit (new), and implict (new,
which are also distributed).  The explicit distributed surfaces are
useful to save memory when huge numbers of surface elements are
defined.  Implicit surfaces are useful for modeling porous materials
where the structure of the material may be determined by experimental
images.
</P>
<P>These are the doc pages, new or altered commands, tools, and examples
that were added to support these new features:

by the new explcit or implicit surface options.  However tests are
made and error messages should be printed when a not-yet-supported
commmand is used.  See the discussion in <A HREF = "doc/Section_howto.html#howto_13">Section howto

<P>Added a new algorithm for mapping surface elements to grid cells.  The
original algorithm can still be selected via the <A HREF = "doc/global.html">global
surfgrid</A> command.  The <A HREF = "doc/global.html">global
cellmax</A> and <A HREF = "doc/global.html">global splitmax</A>
settings were also added.
</P>
<P>The new algorithm is the default for systems with large surface
element counts.  It should be faster and more scalable than the
previous algorithm when the count of surface elements or processors is
large.
</P>
<P>An overflow bug when using extremely large grids was fixed.

<P>Stan Moore and Alan Stagg (Sandia): Added a <A HREF = "doc/global.html">global
mem/limit</A> option to limit the memory allocated and
used when load-balancing or reordering particles.  For very large
simulations which are memory bound this can enable the simulation to

<P>Stan Moore, Dan Ibanez, and Tim Fuller (Sandia) have done heroic work
to enable SPARTA to work with the open-source <A HREF = "https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos">Kokkos
library</A>.  This is implemented as a
new KOKKOS package in the code.  For an application code like SPARTA,
Kokkos is designed to enable one set of source-code modifications to
run reasonably efficient on a variety of hardware, e.g. multi-core
CPU, GPU, and KNL nodes.  See these sections of the manual for more

node architectures (CPU, GPU, KNL) via Kokkos.
</P>
<P>The timing output produced at the end of a run was enhanced to include
info about fixes that operate during the timestepping.  Depending on

<P>Eric Emdee (PPPL) called attention to an incorrect use of uniform

<P>Fixed a bug with the new <A HREF = "doc/surf_collide.html">surf_collide piston</A>
command which was not tallying properties correctly on the simulation
box boundary when particles were deleted.  Also added a couple new
keywords to the <A HREF = "doc/compute_boundary.html">compute boundary</A> command
and made it's tallying similar to the <A HREF = "doc/compute_surf.html">compute
surf</A> command, by using weighted particle counts
for many of the keywords.
</P>
<P>Added grid groups via the <A HREF = "doc/group.html">group grid</A> command, similar
to surface element groups.  This allows grid cells to be assigned to
one or more groups.  The groups are now used as required or optional
arguments to several compute and fix commands as well as other
commands in this list, to optionally limit which grid cells
computations are performed for:

<P>A new grid <I>group-ID</I> argument is required for the computes in the

cell selection in the histogramming, as are new optional keywords
<I>region</I> and <I>mixture</I> for particle selection in the histogramming.
</P>
<P>BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: This means the syntax for all of the commands
in the above list have changed (except dump grid and the fix ave/histo
commands) because they now require an additional grid group-ID
argument.  The format of restart files also changes with this release,
because the grid group and surface element group information is now
stored differently.

<P>The grid cell group assignments persist when doing grid adaptation,
via the <A HREF = "doc/adapt_grid.html">adapt_grid</A> or <A HREF = "doc/fix_adapt_grid.html">fix
adapt/grid</A> commands, which means new refined
or coarsened grid cells inherit the same group assignment from their

<P>Enhanced the syntax for many commands to allow multiple selected
values from a compute or fix vector, or multiple columns from a
compute or fix array, to be specified with a single argument, using a

variable names were truncated.  Now the full column name, as specified
in the <A HREF = "doc/stats_style.html">stats_style</A> command, is output.  This
includes the "c_", "f_", or "v_" prefix for compute, fix, variable
quantities, so there will be no ambiguity if a compute and fix have
the same ID.
</P>
<P>Added options to the <A HREF = "doc/stats_modify.html">stats_modify format</A> and
<A HREF = "doc/dump_modify.html">dump_modify format</A> commands, and made their
syntax consistent with each other.
</P>
<P>Each now takes a <I>line</I> option to specify the format of an entire line
of output, <I>int</I> and <I>float</I> options to specify the format of each
integer or floating point value output, an <I>M string</I> option to change
the format of a single value in column M of the output, or a <I>none</I>
option to restore the default format for all output values.
</P>
<P>BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: Several of the commands listed above
previously allowed an entire array of input values (from a compute or
fix) to be specified using just the ID of the compute or fix.  You now
have to use the wildcard syntax above to have the same effect.
</P>
<P>BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: This patch can change the format of one line
in the screen or logfile output, namely the header line that describes
the columns of stats output.  If your output includes quantities from
a compute or fix or variable, then that line will have a slightly
different syntax, as described above.  If you have a post-processing
parser that reads that line or uses it to identify columns of data,
you may to need to adjust your parse semantics.
</P>
<P>BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: The <A HREF = "doc/dump_modify.html">dump_modify format</A>
command previously only allowed the format for an entire line to be
specified.  Using that option now requires the "line" setting be used
after "format", to distinguish it from the other options that were
added.

ave/histo/weight</A> commands, to enable
histogramming of global, per-particle, and per-grid cell quantities.
The histograms can also be time averaged if desired.

<P>Also added an internal-style variable to the "variable" command for

example.  This is more efficient way to enable variable values
to be reset internally by the code.
</P>
<P>BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: The

internal-style variable, not an equal-style variable as input for some
its species, density, and velocity options.

<UL><LI>The numerical round-off fix where surface points are shifted slightly

purposes, but "global surfpush yes" is now the default. 

<LI>The code is now more agressive about marking the corner points as

makes the marking of non-overlapping grid cells as inside versus
outside less likely to get stuck with an error that not all cells
could be marked.

<P>Added grid-style variables to SPARTA as explained on the

<P>Previously, computing a thermal temperature via the <A HREF = "doc/compute_sonine_grid.html">compute

center-of-mass (COM) velocities that were only calculated for the

<P>Options for adapting the hierarchical grid used by SPARTA have been
added.  This can either be done before or between <A HREF = "doc/run.html">run</A>
commands via the <A HREF = "doc/adapt_grid.html">adapt_grid</A>.  Or adaptation can
be performed on-the-fly during a run, via the <A HREF = "doc/fix_adapt.html">fix
adapt</A> command.  Adapation can involve refinement
and/or coarsening of grid cells, based on a variety of criteria,
including values calculated by <A HREF = "doc/compute.html">computes</A> or
<A HREF = "doc/fix.html">fixes</A>.  The <A HREF = "compute_distsurf_grid.html">compute
distsurf/grid</A> command was added to
calculate one such criterion: distance of a grid cell from any surface
element.
</P>
<P>Commands to modify surfaces have also been added.  The
<A HREF = "doc/move_surf.html">move_surf</A> and <A HREF = "doc/fix_move_surf.html">fix
move/surf</A> commands allow a group of surface
elements to be moved in various manners either between runs or during
a run.  The <A HREF = "doc/write_suf.html">write_surf</A> command write surface
elements to a file, which can be useful after clipping has taken
place, surface elements have been moved or removed.  The
<A HREF = "doc/remove_surf.html">remove_surf</A> command can remove a subset of
surface elements from the simulation.
</P>
<P>The list of new commands is here:

a hierarchical grid definition.  This allows the grid to be refined
based on whether a grid cell is inside a geometric region defined by
the <A HREF = "doc/region.html">region</A> command.  Regions can be simple geometric
objects or unions or intersections of simple objects or other unions
or intersections.  This is thus a more flexible way of defining a
hierarchical grid.

</P>
<P>Several new features are added to the code in this version.
</P>
<P>The ambipolar approximation for plasmas (charged particles) is now
supported.  See <A HREF = "doc/Section_howto.html#howto_11">Section howto 4.11</A>
for details of how the ambipolar approximation is implemented in
SPARTA and how to use it from an input script.  Relevant commands
inlcude:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "doc/fix_ambipolar.html">fix ambipolar</A>
<LI><A HREF = "doc/collide_modify.html">collide_modify ambipolar yes</A>
<LI><A HREF = "doc/react.html">react</A> command with ambipolar reactions
<LI><A HREF = "doc/compute_count.html">compute count</A> 
</UL>
<P>Gas reaction models for ionization were added to the dissociation and
exchange options, all of which can now be specified via the
<A HREF = "doc/react.html">react</A> command.  These can now include ambipolar
reactions involvoing ambipolar ions and their electrons.
</P>
<P>Surface reaction models for dissociation, exchange, and recombination
can now be specified via the <A HREF = "doc/surf_react.html">surf_react</A> command.
These can include ambipolar reactions, e.g. recombination of ions and
their electrons.
</P>
<P>Surface groups were added so that properties like collision and
reaction models can be assigned to subsets of surface elements.  This
is implemented via a new <A HREF = "doc/group.html">group</A> commmand.  Several
commands now take surface group IDs as arguments, changing their
syntax.  The following commands are affected.
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "doc/read_surf.html">read_surf</A>
<LI><A HREF = "doc/compute_surf.html">compute surf</A>
<LI><A HREF = "doc/fix_ave_surf.html">fix ave/surf</A>
<LI><A HREF = "doc/surf_modify.html">surf_modify</A> 
</UL>
<P>Also the <A HREF = "doc/bound_modify.html">bound_modify</A> command syntax is
changed, since surface reaction models can be assigned to simulation
box boundaries as well.
</P>
<P>The fix inflow and fix inflow/file commands were renamed to <A HREF = "doc/fix_emit_face.html">fix
emit/face</A> and <A HREF = "doc/fix_emit_face_file.html">fix
emit/face/file</A>.  
</P>
<P>A new <A HREF = "doc/fix_emit_surf.html">fix emit/surf</A> command was added to
enable outflux of particles from surface elements.
</P>
<P>A <I>region</I> option was added to the
<A HREF = "doc/create_particles">create_particles</A>, <A HREF = "doc/fix_emit_face.html">fix
emit/face</A>, and <A HREF = "fix_emit_face_file.html">fix
emit/face/file</A> commands.  This allows
creation of particles within limited geometric regions of the
simualation domain.
</P>
<P>All the dump commmands now take a "group" argument, changing their
syntax, to select which particles, grid cells, or surface elements are
output.  I.e. the dump particle and dump image commands take a
mixture-ID as an argument, the dump grid command takes a grid group ID
as an argument (only "all" is currently an option), and the dump
surface command takes a surface group ID as an argument.  See the
<A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> command doc page for details.
</P>
<P>A bug was fixed for the <A HREF = "doc/fix_emit_face_file.html">fix
emit/face/file</A> cmomand when using it for
2d axisymmetric models.  The appropriate axisummetric volume
weightings were not being applied to grid cells to adjust their number
of created particles.
</P>
<P>BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: The internal syntax of <A HREF = "doc/read_restart.html">restart
files</A> changed to add group information.  This
means the current version of the code cannot read old restart files
and vice versa.  The syntax of these commands changed:
<A HREF = "doc/read_surf.html">read_surf</A>, <A HREF = "doc/compute_surf.html">compute surf</A>,
<A HREF = "doc/fix_ave_surf.html">fix ave/surf</A>,
<A HREF = "doc/surf_modify.html">surf_modify</A>,
<A HREF = "doc/bound_modify.html">bound_modify</A>.  Likewise the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump
particle</A>, <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump grid</A>, and <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump
surface</A> command syntax changed to take an extra
argument.  The fix inflow and fix inflow/face commands were renamed to
<A HREF = "doc/fix_emit_face.html">fix emit/face</A> and <A HREF = "doc/fix_emit_face_file.html">fix
emit/face/file</A>.

<P><B>26 Feb 2015</B>
</P>
<P>Added a <A HREF = "doc/fix_inflow_file.html">fix inflow/file</A> command which
allows input of particles on a simulation box face, with properties of
the input specified in a file.  The file contains a mesh of points
that overlay part or all of the box face.  Quantities can be defined
at the mesh points that affect the created particles, e.g. a streaming
velocity, thermal temperature, number fractions of species in the
mixture, overall density, etc.  The quantities can vary spatially on
the mesh, so that the input flux of particles is also spatially
varying.
</P>
<P>There is an examples/flowfile directory with an example input script,

<P>Two small bug fixes in the <A HREF = "doc/collide/html">VSS collision model</A>.
One could generate unrealistic temperatures as the outcome of certain
reactions.  The second was a bookkeeping error for the code vs the
format of the input data file of reactions, with regard to
dissociation reactions producing only monoatomic products (molecule +
atom -> 3 atoms).

<P>Fixed an rare bug with particle moves hitting exactly on the
edge or corner point of a surface element that is in common with
multiple surfaces.
</P>
<P>Also found a case where the <A HREF = "doc/global.html">global surfpush yes</A>
command needs to move surface points that are slightly outside a grid
cell to be on the surface, not just from inside to the surface (just
for the intersection operation).  So the <I>surfpush</I> option now does
both.

vibrational relaxation, instead of just the <I>constant</I> parameters used
previously.  The additional 4 parameters per species needed for the

Bird, and a hybrid Total Collision Energy / Quantum Kinetic (TCE/QK)
model (both parts due to Bird).  The same input file of reactions and
reaction coefficients can be used for either.  To use the hybrid
style, flags in the reaction file can be set to "A" or "Q" for each
reaction to specify whether it is performed using the TCE (Arrhenius)

<P>Fixed a numerical round-off issue with the intersection of surface
elements and grid cells.  This could cause an error when the
<A HREF = "doc/read_surf.html">read_surf</A> command was used if the surface had
points that were "nearly" on grid cell boundaries.  The work-around is
to shift any such points from slightly inside a grid cell to the cell
boundary (just for the intersection operation).  This operation can
now be invoked by the <A HREF = "doc/global.html">global surfpush yes</A> command.
At some point we will likely automatically invoke it if the error
occurs consistently.

tools directory to create a grid file, readable by the
<A HREF = "doc/read_grid.html">read_grid</A> command, which has been adapted to a
surface file, readable by the <A HREF = "doc/read_surf.html">read_surf</A> command.
</P>
<P>The tool has several options for how the adaptation is done.  At this
point, the adaptivity is strictly based on geometric considerations.
At some point we will add flow characteristics to the options, so the
new computational grid can reflect attributes of a previously computed
flow field.

<P>One change for applying cell weights to collisions was missing from
the 11Aug14 patch for enabling axi-symmetry.

<P><B>14 Aug 2014</B>
</P>
<P>New <A HREF = "doc/compute_lambda_grid.html">compute lambda/grid</A> command, which
can calcluate the mean free path and Knudsen number for each grid
cell.  This can be dumped to a file via the dump command and used to
adapt the computational grid, e.g. between two runs.
</P>
<P>Soon we will also release an external script in the tools directory
to perform this adpativity operation.

</P>
<P>Added a <A HREF = "doc/scale_particles.html">scale_particles</A> command to allow
the total number of particles in the simulation to be scaled up or
down via particle cloning or deletion.  This is useful for changing
the resolution of a model between runs.

</P>
<P>Added a <A HREF = "doc/Section_tools.html#stlsurf">stl2surf.py tool</A> to the tools
directory to convert stereolithography (STL) files to SPARTA-format
surface files, which can be read by the <A HREF = "doc/read_surf.html">read_surf</A>
command.
</P>
<P>The STL files must be in ASCII (text) format, which can be produced by
various meshing programs.  Note that surface object(s) in the STL file
must be "watertight" in order to be used by SPARTA (unless they are
being clipped to the simulation box), as described on the
<A HREF = "doc/read_surf.html">read_surf</A> doc page.

<P>Added an axi-symmetry capability to allow 2d simulations with a y=0
axis of symmetry to be run.  See the <A HREF = "doc/boundary.html">boundary</A> and
<A HREF = "doc/global.html">global weight</A> commands for details, and also
<A HREF = "doc/Section_howto.html#howto_2">Section 4.2</A> for an overview
discussion.
