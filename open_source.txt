Open-Source Distribution :h3

SPARTA comes with no warranty of any kind.  As each source file
states in its header, it is a copyrighted code that is distributed
free-of-charge, under the terms of the "GNU Public License"_gnu (GPL),
or sometimes (by request) under the terms of the "GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL)"_gnu2.  This is often referred to as open-source
distribution - see "www.gnu.org"_gnuorg or
"www.opensource.org"_opensource.  The legal text of the GPL or LGPL is
in the LICENSE file that is included in the SPARTA distribution.

Here is a summary of what the GPL means for SPARTA users:

(1) Anyone is free to use, modify, or extend SPARTA in any way they
choose, including for commercial purposes.

(2) If you distribute a modified version of SPARTA, it must remain
open-source, meaning you distribute it under the terms of the GPL.
You should clearly annotate such a code as a derivative version of
SPARTA.

(3) If you release any code that includes SPARTA source code, then it
must also be open-sourced, meaning you distribute it under the terms
of the GPL.

(4) If you give SPARTA files to someone else, the GPL LICENSE file and
source file headers (including the copyright and GPL notices) should
remain part of the code.
