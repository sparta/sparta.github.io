Tim Bartel (tjbarte at sandia.gov) was the chief author of the 2d
"ICARUS DSMC code"_http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/dsmc.html, a
predecessor to SPARTA.  Some of the parallelization ideas developed
for ICARUS have also been useful in SPARTA.

Dan Rader and Steve Kempka, both managers at Sandia, provided
enthusiastic support for SPARTA development and its release as
open-source software.
