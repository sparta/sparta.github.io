Report bugs and request new features in SPARTA :h3

You can do both of these on the "SPARTA GitHub
page"_https://github.com/sparta/sparta; see details below.

You can also do this via the "SPARTA mail list"_mail.html, by simply
sending an email to "sparta-users at lists.sourceforge.net".  This
would be more appropriate if you are not sure something is a bug, or
you just want to know if some feature is already available in SPARTA
or possible for you or someone else to implement.  If it indeed seems
to be a bug, you may get asked to submit the full info through the
GitHub site.

requests"_https://github.com/sparta/sparta/pulls.  Click on the
checked "Closed" heading to see previous pull requests.  Click on "New
