Report bugs and request new features in SPARTA :h3

You can do both of these on the "SPARTA GitHub
page"_https://github.com/sparta/sparta; see details below.

You can also do this via the "SPARTA mail list"_mail.html, by simply
sending an email to "sparta-users at lists.sourceforge.net".  This
would be more appropriate if you are not sure something is a bug, or
you just want to know if some feature is already available in SPARTA
or possible for you or someone else to implement.  If it indeed seems
to be a bug, you may get asked to submit the full info through the
GitHub site.

Report a bug via GitHub:

If you fix a bug, or implement a new feature, you can
submit it via the GitHub site, as a pull request.

Here is the page of currently "open pull
requests"_https://github.com/sparta/sparta/pulls.  Click on the
checked "Closed" heading to see previous pull requests.  Click on "New
pull request" to submit a new one.

Document an issue or suggest a new feature via GitHub:

"https://github.com/sparta/sparta/issues"_https://github.com/sparta/sparta/issues

You can browse the details and discussions on previously posted
issues, or click the "new issue" button at the top right.

Note that you can add labels to issues.  The bug reports are simply
issues flagged with a "bug" label.

Regarding bugs, the following
"quote"_http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/quotes.html seems apropos:

{As we know, there are known knowns. There are things we know we know.
We also know there are known unknowns. That is to say, we know there
are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns,
the ones we don't know.} -- Donald Rumsfeld

This "page"_unknown.html lists unknown bugs in SPARTA.
