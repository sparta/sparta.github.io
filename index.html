<P>SPARTA is an acronym for Stochastic PArallel Rarefied-gas
Time-accurate Analyzer.
</P>
<P>SPARTA is a parallel DSMC or Direct Simulation Monte Carlo code for
performing simulations of low-density gases in 2d or 3d.  Particles
advect through a hierarchical Cartesian grid that overlays the
simulation box.  The grid is used to group particles by grid cell for
purposes of performing collisions and chemistry.  Physical objects
with triangulated surfaces can be embedded in the grid, creating cut
and split grid cells.  The grid is also used to efficiently find
particle/surface collisions.
</P>
<P>SPARTA runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing
techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain.  The
code is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
functionality.
</P>
<P>SPARTA is distributed as an <A HREF = "open_source.html">open source code</A> under
the terms of the <A HREF = "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</A>, or sometimes (by request) under the terms

version can be downloaded <A HREF = "https://sjplimp.github.io//download.html">here</A>.

<UL><LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (4/23) Release of version 13 Apr 2023. It
includes support for Python 3, a new <A HREF = "doc/fix_surf_temp.html">fix
surf/temp</A> command, support for custom
per-grid-cell attributes, an optimized particle move algorithm when a
model has a regular grid and no surface elements, a new option for the
create_particles command to add particles in grid cells cut by surface
elements.  See more details <A HREF = "bug.html">here</A>.  

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (7/22) Release of version 18 July 2022.
It includes new options for the <A HREF = "doc/compute_surf.html">compute surf</A>
command, a new <A HREF = "doc/surf_collide.html">no-slip option</A> for specular
surface collisiont, and a new <A HREF = "doc/surf_collide.html">surface collision adiabatic
model</A> with isotropic scattering.  See more
details <A HREF = "bug.html">here</A>.  

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (2/22) Options to add various kinds of
external fields to influence particle advection.  They can be
spatially or time varying and applied on a per-particle or
per-grid-cell basis. See the doc page for the <A HREF = "doc/global.html">global
field</A> command. 

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (10/21) Added a surf_react adsorb command
which has support for on-surface chemistry reactions and storage of
surface state, i.e. per-surface-element concentrations of various
on-surface species.  This enables modeling of both gas/surface and
surface/surface chemical reaction networks. 

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (11/20) Removed hierarchical grid parent
cells from the internally stored data structures.  The code now only
stores child cells.  For large problems with many levels of grid
adaptation, this frees up a large amount of memory. 

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (1/20) Added support for <A HREF = "doc/Section_howto.html#howto_15">transparent
surfaces</A> which tally statistics when
particles pass throught them.

<A HREF = "doc/Section_howto.html#howto_14">ablation modeling</A> of implicit
surface elements: <A HREF = "doc/fix_ablate.html">fix ablate</A>, <A HREF = "doc/compute_isurf_grid.html">compute
isurf/grid</A>, <A HREF = "doc/compute_react_isurf_grid.html">compute
react/isurf/grid</A>,

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (4/19) Added support for implicit 2d and
3d surface elements defined by a grid corner point values in a read-in
file.  These are in contrast to explicit surface elements defined by
line segments (2d) or triangles (3d). 

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (2/19) Added support for distributed
surface elements so that complex surfaces with huge element counts
can be modeled, with the elements stored acrossed processors. 

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (8/18) SPARTA development is now
supported on <A HREF = "https://github.com/sparta/sparta">GitHub</A> and with a

accelerator options on a variety of new machines and hardware,
including multi-core CPUs (via threading), GPUs, and KNLs. 

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (12/17) Added a KOKKOS package to the
code to allow building with the open-source Kokkos library which

grids via the <A HREF = "doc/compute_fft_grid.html">compute fft/grid</A>
command. 

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (8/16) Added <A HREF = "doc/fix_ave_histo.html">fix
ave/histo</A> and <A HREF = "doc/fix_ave_histo.html">fix
ave/histo/weight</A> commands to enable
histogramming of various quantities during a simulation. 

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (1/16) Added <A HREF = "doc/variable.html">grid-style
variables</A> so that user-defined per-grid quantities
can be calculated on-the-fly and output more easily. 

<LI><IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (10/15) Added a <A HREF = "doc/collide_modify.html">near-neighbor collision
model</A> for selecting pairs of collision
partners.

SPARTA calculations)

<P>This is work by Michael Gallis (magalli at sandia.gov) at Sandia.
</P>
<P>This calculation was done to model Richtmyer/Meshkov mixing which
occurs when a light gas is on top of a heavier gas and a shock induces
mixing and turbulent effects.
</P>
<P>This is a large 2d calculation of He (green) on top of Ar (red).  4.5B
particles were run with 400M grid cells for 240K timesteps.  The
simulation was run on 32K nodes (16 cores per node, 512K MPI tasks) of
the Sequoia BG/Q machine at Lawrence Livermore National Labs (LLNL).
</P>
<P>Snapshot images of the simulation were created using SPARTA's <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command, rather than saving particle data
to disk.  The first 2 images are the initial and final state of the
simulation.  The rightmost image is a movie of the simulation.
