<P>SPARTA is an acronym for Stochastic PArallel Rarefied-gas
Time-accurate Analyzer.
</P>
<P>SPARTA is a parallel DSMC or Direct Simulation Monte Carlo code for
performing simulations of low-density gases in 2d or 3d.  Particles
advect through a hierarchical Cartesian grid that overlays the
simulation box.  The grid is used to group particles by grid cell for
purposes of performing collisions and chemistry.  Physical objects
with triangulated surfaces can be embedded in the grid, creating cut
and split grid cells.  The grid is also used to efficiently find
particle/surface collisions.
</P>
<P>SPARTA runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing
techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain.  The
code is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
functionality.
</P>
<P>SPARTA is distributed as an <A HREF = "open_source.html">open source code</A> under
the terms of the <A HREF = "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</A>, or sometimes (by request) under the terms

version can be downloaded <A HREF = "https://sjplimp.github.io/download.html">here</A>.

<P>This is work by Michael Gallis (magalli at sandia.gov) at Sandia.
</P>
<P>This calculation was done to model Richtmyer/Meshkov mixing which
occurs when a light gas is on top of a heavier gas and a shock induces
mixing and turbulent effects.
</P>
<P>This is a large 2d calculation of He (green) on top of Ar (red).  4.5B
particles were run with 400M grid cells for 240K timesteps.  The
simulation was run on 32K nodes (16 cores per node, 512K MPI tasks) of
the Sequoia BG/Q machine at Lawrence Livermore National Labs (LLNL).
</P>
<P>Snapshot images of the simulation were created using SPARTA's <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command, rather than saving particle data
to disk.  The first 2 images are the initial and final state of the
simulation.  The rightmost image is a movie of the simulation.
